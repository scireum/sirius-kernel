/**
 * Tracks the execution of a blocking operation.
 * <p>
 * The operations framework is used to track blocking operations which might possibly hang. As a blocking operation
 * cannot be checked by the calling thread itself, the classical alternative would be to fork a thread which
 * monitors the operation. As this approach does not scale very well, the operations framework creates a
 * lighweight <tt>Operation</tt> object around a potentially blocking operation using a try-with-resources block.
 * <p>
 * A metrics provider will check for all operations and use its limits (set by <tt>component-kernel.conf</tt>,
 * to warn if too many operations are active (or are probably hanging).
 * <p>
 * Other frameworks can provider further help: <tt>SIRIUS-WEB</tt> e.g. provides a list of all operations
 * using the <i>async</i> command in the system console.
