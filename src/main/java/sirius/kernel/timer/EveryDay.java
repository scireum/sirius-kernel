/**
 * Parts registered for this interface will be invoked one time per day.
 * <p>
 * An implementing class can be inserted into the {@link sirius.kernel.di.GlobalContext} using the
 * {@link sirius.kernel.di.std.Register} annotation. Once the system is started, the method
 * {@link sirius.kernel.timer.TimedTask#runTimer()} is invoked once per day. The hour within the call will take place
 * is determined by the config value named in {@link #getConfigKeyName()}. (The full path in the config
 * will be <tt>timer.daily.[getConfigKeyName]</tt>).
 * <p>
 * The call interval will not be exactly one day, as the time of invocation will vary from day to day. The system
 * ensures, that the method is called within the given hour of day, and not executed more than once per day. However,
 * if the system is restarted within the given hour, the method might be called twice, as the time of call is not
 * persisted over restarts. If a more precise behaviour is required, the subclass must take care of handling such
 * cases.
 * <p>
 * Note that for cleanup and maintenance tasks one can also implement a {@link EndOfDayTask}. These tasks will
 * also run on a daily basis but within a pre-defined time window.
